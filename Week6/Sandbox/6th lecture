natural selection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

linkage disequilibrium is correlation between polymorphisms, i.e. polymorphisms
that always occur together are highly linked


if pop evolving neutrally, LD tends to equilibrium (no correlation beween alleles)

when addvantageous mutation arises, genetic variation driven down, raises linkage disequlibrium 
(a selective sweep) 

duffy null allele is most fixed allele i nhumans? or maybe most different between any populations


malagasy population founded by two pops, one with duffy-null (100% pop have this), one with vivaz malaria. can 
look t osee if d-n gets fixed quick.
rates of duffy0null higher than HW would predict. Is this drift or nat select?

carry out drift simulations to see if could be drift


MISSED BARE IMPORTANT SHIT HERE

ended up showing streong selection for d-n allele (7% advatage for thiose with duffy null)
