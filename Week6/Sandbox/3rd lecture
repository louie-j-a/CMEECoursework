Population Structure - Dr Jason Hodgson
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


pops are level at which evolution occurs??
--------------------------------------------------


mutations
------------------------


recombination also causes evolution
----------------------------


Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

expectation for genotype freq in pop given allele freq (given no evolution) 
- null hypothesis

conditions for this -
large pops (infiinite)
no mutations
no gene flow
no selection
random mating

never met in real life but some pops closer to this than others

-------------------------------------------------------------------

most var selectively neutral

var is function of pop size and mut rate

larger pop size = more heterozygosity?
------------------------------------------------------

panmixia

idealised population?

see slide for features
-----------------------------------------------------------


deme - individuals in this group are more likely to mate within this group
----------------------------------------------------------------


good to know how variatin and geography affect pop structure so can extimate future changes
---------------------------------------------------------


how structure develops

nat selection - in humans most diff due to this???????, 
resistance to malaria SNP (in sub saharan af) missed some shit here???????????

some shit bout drift missed here too FUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK
--------------------------------------------------------------------


missed bare shit here
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


F stats are observed heterozygosity compared to hardy weinberg expectations

see slides

Fst most used - structure of subpops compared to total pop
equal to 1 - (observed heterozygotes / expected heterozygots)

expected het is 2pq in H-W

genetic structure is deficit of heterozygosity

Fst closer to 1 = more structure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


how did he adjust for Fst in graph????
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


READ: inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data by Jonathan Pritchard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


structure approach - try various K's and see which fits data the best

missed more shit here
-------------------------------------------


larger allele diffs between groups give info on structure, easier to fit groups in to H-W
after you split them
------------------------------------------------------------


Li et al 2008 science
pop structured by continents
middle east shows mixingof europe and africa and a bit of asia too
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(is this from above paper?), big diff between african and rest of world due to pop bottle neck 
therefore small pop and large drift
--------------------------------------


read his stuff on madagasccar populations 
(also google jarawa genetics)
--------------------------------------------------------


fuuuuuuccckkkk
missed the ending


carry on from 3rd lecture?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PCA approach

doesnt rely on model or any assumptions, just looks for patterns in data
-------------------------------------------------------------------


shiiiiiiiiiiit
