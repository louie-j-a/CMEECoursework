gene flow and migrations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


look for errors in tree, map migrations on and see if redces errors (TREEMIX)

----------------------------------------------------

migrant tracts - assign length of chrom to a population, length of tracts decays with 
migration events

--------------------------

easier to tell african genetics from non african due to the bottle neck that occured when humans left africa
